# App Flow Document for Bucket & MediaID

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
When a new user first arrives at the Bucket platform, they land on a clean, minimal landing page inviting them to join or sign in. They can choose between creating an account with their email and a password or using a social login such as Google or Facebook. If they opt for email and password, they enter their chosen address and password, then receive a verification email. Clicking the link in that email confirms their address and brings them back to the app. If the user ever forgets their password, they visit the sign-in page and click "Forgot Password," enter their email, and receive a reset link that allows them to choose a new password. The user can also sign out at any point by clicking their profile avatar in the header and choosing "Sign Out." Throughout this flow, clear prompts guide the user from one step to the next, ensuring the account creation process feels straightforward and secure.

After verifying their email or completing social login, the user is led into a brief welcome tutorial. This tutorial uses a series of full-screen panels to introduce the Artist Locker, the subscription model, and how MediaID powers privacy and personalization. At the end of this guided tour, the user is prompted to complete their profile by choosing a display name and uploading an optional photo. They are then asked to tag three to five primary interests, laying the foundation for a tailored experience across Bucket and any integrated partner apps.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
Once onboarded, the user lands on the main dashboard. For fans, this page greets them with a personalized feed of artist Buckets that match their interests. A fixed header displays the platform logo and the user’s avatar, while a collapsible sidebar on the left offers access to Home, Locker, Discover, and Settings. The center of the screen shows a scrollable grid of artist previews, each card featuring the artist’s name, subscription price, and a small thumbnail of the latest unlocked content. In the top right corner, a search box allows fans to look up specific artists or tags.

Artists see a different dashboard after login. They arrive at a revenue overview page featuring a simple chart of subscription income, brand campaign earnings, and code conversion payouts. A sidebar menu gives them quick links to Upload Content, Schedule Releases, Brand Partnerships, Analytics, and Account Settings. The main pane highlights today’s Locker open rate, subscriber growth, and recommended brand matches. A button labeled "New Release" sits prominently to guide artists straight into the upload flow.

Brand marketers are routed to their own dashboard, which opens with a segment builder widget front and center. This widget lets them choose from a fixed list of interest tags or open an advanced mode to build custom filters. Below it, an interactive campaign summary panel shows projected reach and estimated engagement based on the selected segments. The sidebar includes Campaigns, Analytics, Billing, and Privacy Controls. A "Create Campaign" button in the main pane prompts brand users into the next flow step.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
When a fan taps an artist preview from the dashboard, they arrive at the artist’s landing page. Here, they see a larger banner, a brief bio, and a list of subscription tiers with prices. Selecting a tier opens a Stripe Checkout modal where the fan can enter payment details or use saved methods. Upon successful payment, the modal closes and the fan is routed to the Locker view.

Inside the Locker, content is organized by date and milestone sections. Tapping any unlocked item opens a full-screen media player for audio or video files or a lightbox for images and documents. Below the media, a comment field invites fans to leave reactions. Share icons allow social media or direct link sharing. Brand campaign assets, when relevant, appear inline with a "Sponsored" label and an optional call to action. To return to the main dashboard, the fan clicks the home icon in the header or uses the browser’s back button.

Artists click "New Release" from their dashboard to begin uploading content. They choose a file from their computer—supported formats include standard audio (mp3, wav, aac), video (mp4, mov), and images (jpg, png, gif). They enter a title, description, and choose a release date or community milestone condition. A scheduler interface presents a calendar view where the artist picks the exact unlock time. After hitting "Schedule," the file is stored and queued for the release date. The artist is then returned to their dashboard where the new scheduled item appears in the Upcoming Releases list.

When brand marketers click "Create Campaign," they open the campaign builder. They first select segments by clicking interest tags or expanding the advanced view to add custom filters such as location or fan activity thresholds. Next, they upload creative assets and craft a message. The builder then presents payment options: a flat fee, pay-per-engagement, or pay-per-conversion. Choosing any option opens a Stripe Checkout session to capture payment. Upon completion, the user sees a confirmation screen with a live link to analytics. They can then click "View Campaign Dashboard" to monitor impressions, engagement metrics, and code redemption rates. From this analytics view, marketers can pause, edit, or duplicate the campaign, and then return to their main dashboard via the sidebar.

Developers integrating with MediaID access an OAuth2-protected API. They log into the Developer Portal, register their application, and receive client credentials. They configure webhook endpoints to receive real-time permission change events. Sample code snippets illustrate how to query the preference graph for consented interest tags. A test ledger endpoint lets developers fetch anonymous interaction logs for simulation. Each API call respects the user’s privacy settings and enforces role-based access control on the backend.

## Settings and Account Management
Users access settings from the sidebar and arrive at a unified Account page. Here they can update their display name, email address, and password. A separate section labeled Privacy and Permissions houses all MediaID controls. Fans and creators alike see switches for general data sharing, location access, audio capture, and anonymous interaction logging. They can also open an event permissions panel to grant or revoke access for specific dates or artist events. A ledger view shows every recorded interaction with date and type; users can select entries and clear them individually or wipe the entire ledger. Changes to any setting prompt a confirmation toast and are saved immediately.

Subscription management lives under a Billing tab in settings for both fans and brand marketers. Fans see their active subscriptions with cancel or pause options, next billing date, and payment method details. Brand users can view invoices, download receipts, or update card information. Canceling a subscription triggers a final confirmation dialog and then retains access until the end of the paid period. Users return to the dashboard by clicking the Home link in the header or selecting Dashboard in the sidebar.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
If a user enters an incorrect password, the sign-in page displays a clear error message highlighting the mistake. After multiple failed attempts, the system may temporarily lock the account and prompt the user to reset their password. Forgotten password flows always confirm that a reset link has been sent, even if the email address is not registered, to avoid revealing user existence. During file uploads, if a user tries to upload an unsupported format or a file that exceeds size limits, the upload form displays a notice explaining the allowed formats and maximum sizes, and the user can retry after correction.

In cases of lost connectivity, the app presents a full-screen overlay indicating the offline status. The user’s last state remains visible beneath, and a retry button attempts to reconnect. If any API call returns an unauthorized error, the user is redirected to the sign-in page. Payment failures in Stripe Checkout show the specific reason—card declined, expired card, or network error—and give the option to use a different payment method. If a user tries to perform an action they are not permitted to do, such as a fan trying to access the brand campaign builder, the app shows a friendly access denied page with a link back to their home dashboard.
