# Next Steps and Secure Architecture Proposal

Thank you for the clear project summary. Below is a high-level plan that maps key features to our security principles and outlines the next steps.

## 1. Infrastructure & Deployment

• Host frontend (React + Tailwind) behind a CDN (e.g., Cloudflare) with HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ enforced.  
• Use Supabase for backend services (Auth, Postgres, Storage, RLS).  
• Deploy serverless functions (for Stripe webhooks, OAuth2 middleware) in a least-privileged environment (e.g., AWS Lambda with fine-grained IAM).  
• Enforce infrastructure as code (Terraform) with secure defaults and no public access to databases or buckets.

## 2. Authentication & Access Control

• **Supabase Auth** for email/password and social logins (Google/Facebook) with email verification and strong password policies (bcrypt/Argon2).  
• Implement **MFA** for artist and brand accounts.  
• Use **JWT** with RS256, short TTLs, and refresh tokens stored in Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict cookies.  
• Define RBAC roles (`public`, `fan`, `artist`, `brand`, `admin`) in Supabase; enforce server-side role checks on every endpoint.

## 3. Data Protection & Privacy

• **Encrypt at rest**: Ensure Supabase storage (Postgres, Object Storage) uses AES-256.  
• **Encrypt in transit**: Strict HTTPS/TLS, HSTS header.  
• **PII handling**: Store only necessary PII; mask logs and error messages.  
• **Secrets**: Keep API keys (Stripe, Social OAuth) in an external vault (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager), not in code or env files.

## 4. API & Service Security

• All API endpoints behind TLS; validate every request.  
• **Rate limiting** on critical endpoints (login, subscription creation, brand campaign creation).  
• **CORS** restricted to known origins (`bucket.mediaid.app`, partner domains).  
• Enforce proper HTTP verbs and return minimal data.

## 5. Frontend Security Hygiene

• Implement **CSP** (allow only self, approved CDNs), **X-Frame-Options** (DENY), **X-Content-Type-Options** (nosniff), **Referrer-Policy** (strict-origin-when-cross-origin).  
• Sanitize and encode all dynamic content in React.  
• Store only non-sensitive tokens in memory; avoid `localStorage` for auth tokens.

## 6. File Upload & Media Security

• Validate file types/extensions and maximum size client- and server-side.  
• Scan uploads (e.g., ClamAV).  
• Store in Supabase Storage with private buckets; generate signed URLs with short expiry.  
• Enforce path traversal prevention and restrict uploads to artist owners (RLS policies).

## 7. RBAC & Row-Level Security (RLS)

• Define RLS policies for Postgres tables:  
  - `artist_locker`: artist sees their content; fans see unlocked items.  
  - `subscriptions`: fan can read their own; artist reads subscriber list.  
  - `campaigns`: brand sees only their campaigns; artists see placements in their lockers.  
• Test every policy with edge cases (public routes vs. authenticated).

## 8. MediaID & OAuth2 Integration

• Design OAuth2 scopes (`media:read`, `media:write`, `preferences:read`, etc.).  
• Implement standard authorization code grant with PKCE for developer SDK.  
• Provide granular consent screens aligned with user privacy controls.  
• Log token usage to the Media Engagement Ledger (anonymous by default).

## 9. CI/CD & DevOps Security

• Integrate SAST/DAST tools into the pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions + Dependabot + Snyk).  
• Perform automated vulnerability scanning on container images and dependencies.  
• Deploy ephemeral review apps behind auth; disable debug in production.  
• Enforce branch protections, code reviews, and signed commits.

## 10. MVP Timeline & Deliverables

Week 1:  
• Scaffold React UI + secure headers.  
• Supabase Auth + basic RBAC + RLS policies.  

Week 2:  
• Stripe Checkout integration with secure webhook handlers.  
• MediaID preference tagging UI with server-side validation.  

Week 3:  
• Brand dashboard with campaign builder; secure file uploads.  
• Implement rate limiting and CORS for APIs.  

Week 4:  
• Analytics integration (Mixpanel, GA) with privacy-first tracking.  
• Soft launch, pentest prep, external partner API v1 rollout.
