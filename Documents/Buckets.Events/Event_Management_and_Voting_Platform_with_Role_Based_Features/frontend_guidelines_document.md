# Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

Below is a detailed, phase-by-phase plan to build your Event Management and Voting Platform. We’ll break it down into logical stages, tie each stage to key features, and call out front-end, back-end, and integration tasks.

---

## Phase 0 – Project Kickoff & Foundations (Week 1)

1. **Team alignment**
   • Review goals, roles, and core principles (low friction, role-aware, config-first).  
   • Finalize sprint cadence and communication channels.
2. **Repo & CI/CD setup**
   • Initialize Git repositories (frontend/react-ts, backend/node).  
   • Configure CI pipeline (GitHub Actions / CircleCI) for linting, tests, and deploy to staging.  
3. **Environment management**
   • Define environment variables (.env for dev, staging, prod).  
   • Provision AWS accounts and basic resources (S3 buckets, RDS stub).
4. **Documentation & style guide**
   • Draft README with high-level architecture.  
   • Create basic design tokens (colors, fonts) and add to a single `theme.ts` file.

Deliverables: Repo scaffold, CI pipeline, initial docs, theme file.

---

## Phase 1 – Core Frontend Infrastructure (Week 2)

1. **React & TypeScript setup**
   • Create React app with TypeScript template.  
   • Install key dependencies: Styled-Components, i18next, React Router, Axios, Socket.IO client stub.
2. **Folder structure**
   • `/components`, `/pages`, `/hooks`, `/services`, `/i18n`, `/styles`, `/utils`.  
   • Add index files for barrel exports.
3. **Global styling & theme**
   • Configure `ThemeProvider` with light/dark modes if needed.  
   • Add global reset and base typography in `GlobalStyle`.
4. **Localization scaffolding**
   • Initialize i18next with English/Spanish JSON files.  
   • Wrap App in `I18nextProvider` and add language switcher stub.
5. **Routing baseline**
   • Install React Router.  
   • Create routes: `/`, `/login`, `/dashboard`, `/event/create`, `/event/:id`, `/artist/claim`, `/admin`.

Deliverables: Working dev build, routing, theming, i18n framework.

## Phase 2 – Event Creation Wizard (Week 3–4)

### Week 3
1. **Step components**
   • Build generic `Wizard`, `Step`, and navigation controls.  
   • Create steps: “Basic Info,” “Voting Config,” “Access & Visibility,” “Review & Save.”
2. **Form management**
   • Install React Hook Form or Formik + Yup for validation.  
   • Define schema for event payload.
3. **API integration**
   • Front-end: create service in `/services/events.ts` using Axios.  
   • Back-end: stub endpoints `POST /api/events`, `PUT /api/events/:id`.

### Week 4
4. **UX polish**
   • Add inline validation feedback.  
   • Show progress bar and step titles.
5. **Save & resume**
   • Store draft in localStorage or call `PATCH` to save partial data.  
   • Load draft on wizard start if exists.
6. **Unit & integration tests**
   • Write Jest + React Testing Library tests for wizard navigation and form validation.

Deliverables: Fully functional event wizard, API hooks, tests.

## Phase 3 – SMS-Based Join Flow & Authentication (Week 5)

1. **Landing page for SMS link**
   • Build `/join/:eventCode` page.  
   • Ask user for phone number; call backend `POST /api/auth/sms/send`.
2. **OTP verification**
   • Build `/verify` page; input code; call `POST /api/auth/sms/verify`.  
   • On success, store JWT in localStorage / HttpOnly cookie.
3. **Routing guard**
   • Add ProtectedRoute component to redirect unauthorized users to `/join`.
4. **Backend & Twilio integration**
   • Implement Twilio or mock SMS provider.  
   • Secure endpoints with rate-limit and basic fraud checks.
5. **Tests & fallback**
   • Unit tests for pages.  
   • E2E test (Cypress) for SMS flow (mocking Twilio).

Deliverables: SMS entry flow, auth guard, basic tests.

---

## Phase 4 – Voting Interface & Leaderboard (Week 6–7)

### Week 6
1. **Voting UI**
   • Create `VoteCard`, `OptionList`, and `SubmitVote` button.  
   • Use Context API or lightweight Redux slice for vote state.
2. **Single-round logic**
   • Fetch event config via `GET /api/events/:id`.  
   • Disable vote button until an option is selected.  
3. **Optimistic update**
   • On submit, immediately update UI, then call `POST /api/votes`.
4. **Routing**
   • After voting, redirect to `/event/:id/leaderboard`.

### Week 7
5. **Leaderboard page**
   • Integrate charting library (Recharts or Chart.js).  
   • Poll `GET /api/events/:id/results` every 10 seconds.  
   • Future-proof: wrap polling in a Socket.IO subscription.
6. **End-of-round reveal**
   • After poll returns `roundStatus: closed`, display “Winner is…” banner.
7. **Tests**
   • React Testing Library for components.  
   • Cypress E2E for end-to-end vote → results flow.

Deliverables: Voting UI, leaderboard with dynamic data, tests.

## Phase 5 – Artist Onboarding & Role-Based Dashboards (Week 8)

1. **Artist claim form**
   • Build `/artist/claim` page with form fields (name, bio, image upload).  
   • Integrate with S3 upload via signed URL.
2. **Role detection & routing**
   • On login, decode JWT to get role (fan, artist, admin).  
   • Redirect to role-specific home: `/dashboard/fan`, `/dashboard/artist`, `/dashboard/admin`.
3. **Dashboard skeletons**
   • Create empty dashboard components.  
   • Common layout: sidebar, topbar, content area.
4. **Access control**
   • Hide or show UI elements based on role.  
   • Centralize in `useAuth` hook.

Deliverables: Artist claim flow, role-aware routing, dashboard shell.
