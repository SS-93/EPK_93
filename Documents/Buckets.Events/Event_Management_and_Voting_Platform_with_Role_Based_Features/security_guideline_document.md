# Implementation Plan for Event Management & Voting Platform

This plan outlines a 3-sprint MVP release, integrating security by design, scalability, accessibility, and bilingual support. Each sprint includes feature development, infrastructure setup, security controls, and testing.

---

## Sprint 1: Foundation & Core Services (2 Weeks)

### Objectives
- Establish secure, version-controlled infrastructure and CI/CD
- Implement authentication, authorization, and core data model
- Build Event Setup Wizard (backend+basic frontend)

### Tasks

1. Infrastructure & DevOps
   - Provision AWS resources using infrastructure-as-code (Terraform/CloudFormation):
     • VPC, subnets, security groups (least privilege)
     • RDS (PostgreSQL) with encryption at rest (AWS KMS)
     • S3 buckets (artifacts, avatars) with default encryption, restricted ACLs
     • CloudFront + S3 for static assets (TLS via ACM)
     • Secrets management: AWS Secrets Manager for DB creds, Twilio/SendGrid keys
   - CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions):
     • Install SAST (ESLint, SonarCloud) and SCA (Dependabot, npm audit) scans
     • Enforce lockfiles (`package-lock.json`)
     • Deploy to staging on merge to `main`

2. Backend Setup
   - Initialize Nest.js (or Express+TypeScript) project structure
   - Database schema & migrations (e.g., TypeORM, Prisma): `events`, `artists`, `attendees`, `event_artists`
   - Implement JWT auth with:
     • Password hashing (Argon2) + unique salts
     • Strong password policy (min length, complexity)
     • Session management & token rotation
   - Role-Based Access Control: Fan, Artist, Brand, Admin, Developer
   - Security middleware:
     • Helmet for HTTP headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
     • Rate limiting (express-rate-limit)
     • Input validation (class-validator) & sanitization

3. Frontend Setup
   - Initialize React + TypeScript + Styled-Components
   - Configure i18next (English, Spanish) with language detectors
   - Implement authentication pages (login, signup)
   - Build Event Setup Wizard UI (stepper with form validation)
     • Store draft config in Redux (or Context)
     • Server-side validation on submit

4. Security & QA
   - Unit tests (>80% coverage) and integration tests for auth & event CRUD
   - Run OWASP ZAP scan against staging
   - Security review: ensure no secrets in code, check CORS policy, secure cookies (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict`)

## Sprint 2: SMS Join & Voting Flow (2 Weeks)

### Objectives
- Enable SMS-driven enrollment and single-round voting
- Enforce vote token limits and anti-abuse controls
- Real-time leaderboard (backend stub + frontend display)

### Tasks

1. SMS Integration
   - Configure Twilio webhook endpoint (HTTPS, validated signature)
   - SMS Join Flow:
     • Parse inbound keyword, validate event existence & status
     • Create `attendee` record (hash phone for analytics, store raw under consent)
     • Associate to `event_attendees` with token_status = `unused`
     • Send confirmation SMS via Twilio API
     • Log consent_sms with timestamp

2. Voting Engine
   - Vote token generation & redemption:
     • One active token per attendee per round
     • Secure token (UUID v4), store hashed version in DB
     • Validate incoming vote requests (signature, token, weight limit)
   - Vote recording: insert into `votes` table, update token_status
   - Leaderboard API endpoint with aggregation (cached, e.g., Redis)

3. Frontend Voting UI
   - Voting page: show artists, allow selection, submit vote
   - Poll leaderboard endpoint every 5–10s (Socket.IO stub for future real-time)
   - Display localized UI messages & error handling

4. Security Controls
   - Input validation & parameterized queries to prevent injection
   - Rate limiting per phone/IP/device (Prevent brute-force & spam)
   - CSRF protection on web endpoints (anti-CSRF tokens)
   - Monitor CloudWatch metrics for abnormal SMS/vote spikes

5. Testing & Monitoring
   - End-to-end tests covering SMS join and voting flows (mock Twilio)
   - Performance tests: verify SMS latency <5s, API <150ms under 100 concurrent
   - Configure CloudWatch Alarms & SNS notifications for errors/throttling

## Sprint 3: CRM & Reporting, Artist Onboarding, Recap (2 Weeks)

### Objectives
- Lightweight CRM messaging (SMS & email)
- Artist profile claiming & dashboard
- Recap page, data exports, developer API & webhooks

### Tasks

1. CRM Messaging
   - Integrate SendGrid for email campaigns (templates, metrics)
   - Admin UI for creating segments (by tag, consent, activity)
   - Schedule & send messages (Twilio + SendGrid) with templating
   - Track delivery status & open/click metrics (store in `messages.metrics`)

2. Artist Onboarding & Dashboard
   - Invitation workflow: email/SMS invite with secure claim link (signed JWT)
   - Profile claim UI: update `artists.handles`, `links`, `avatar_url` (upload to S3)
   - Dashboard: show vote counts, trends (charts), export CSV

3. Recap Page & Data Exports
   - Public recap page: publish results (configurable visibility)
   - Admin export endpoints (CSV/JSON) for `attendees`, `votes`, `messages`
   - Data privacy: anonymize attendee identifiers if privacy mode on

4. Developer API & Webhooks
   - Versioned REST API (v1): endpoints for events, attendees, votes
   - Webhook subscription model: secure delivery (HMAC signatures)
   - API rate limits & API key management (rotateable keys)

5. Security, Compliance & Audit
   - Implement audit trail: record admin actions (who, what, when)
   - Anomaly detection stub: log suspicious patterns for review
   - GDPR/CCPA compliance:
     • Consent logs, data deletion endpoint
     • Data retention policy
   - Final OWASP ZAP & dependency vulnerability scan

6. Non-Functional Enhancements
   - Accessibility audit (WCAG AA), fix a11y issues
   - Mobile-first UI refinements
   - Performance tuning: Redis caching of hot endpoints
   - Set up application monitoring (Datadog/NewRelic) and error tracking (Sentry)

## Cross-Cutting Concerns & Ongoing Activities

- **Security Principles Enforcement:** Regularly review code for least privilege, defense-in-depth, secure defaults, fail-secure.
- **Dependency Management:** Weekly SCA scans, update critical patch releases.
- **Secrets Rotation:** Schedule automatic rotation of API keys and DB credentials.
- **Localization:** Add French/Portuguese support in backlog.
- **Documentation:** Maintain API docs (Swagger/OpenAPI), runbooks for incident response.

---

## Open Questions & Risks

- SMS throughput/cost at higher scale: evaluate Twilio vs. alternative short code providers.
- Real-time leaderboard via WebSockets vs. polling: finalize approach before v2.
- GDPR ‘right to be forgotten’ edge cases: confirm deletion scope with legal.
- Payment integration in future sprints: plan Stripe vs. PayPal requirements.
